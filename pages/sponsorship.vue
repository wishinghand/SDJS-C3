    h2 Why Sponsor?
    p.body-text San Diego JavaScript Community is the biggest programming meetup in the San Diego area. We connect newcomers to established talent in the Javascript community. Sponsorship enables companies and organizations to interact directly with this talent pool through branded exposure opportunities. Contributing towards the success of our community challenge enables us to create bigger and better events in the years to come, so companies who partner with us can reach an increasingly wider pool of talent.

    p.body-text San Diego JavaScript Community is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity. Contributions to the San Diego JavaScript Community Bot Challenge are tax-deductible.
